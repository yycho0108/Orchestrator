Using a custom implementation of the [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) Algorithm, this software provides a solution to optimize the sequence at which the rehearsal proceeds.
In this algorithm, the *cost* of transition is evaluated by the number of **new incoming performers**,
and calculates the arrangement of the shortest *distance* based on those metrics.
